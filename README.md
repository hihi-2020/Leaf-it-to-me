# Leaf it to me


# MERGE TIME!! Git Protocol in a Team!
* Feature is done, ready to create a pull request to Development?? 

### 5. Commit your branch
```
git add .  
git commit -m “readyToMerge”   
```

### 6. Pull Development into your branch, open VScode & deal with the conflicts there.

```
git pull origin Development
code .
```
### 7. Vscode

* Files marked C = Conflict
* Files marked M = Modified
* <<<<< Head  = This is you! Current changes, you are HEAD
* <<<<<< Incoming change = pulled in from the Development branch

### 8. Any conflicts or changes need to be saved, added, & committed again

```
git add .
git commit -m “mergeTime”
git push origin myBranch
```
### 9. Github - create pull request

* Create pull request from mybranch to Development (on github)
* Tell the git keeper, they will merge the pull request and there should be 0 conflicts as you have already resolved these in your branch.

### Create a new branch with a new name
```
git checkout -b feature/myNextFeature  
code .  
```
### 10. GitKeeper - merge the request

* Merge the pull request on Github only if there are 0 conflicts, then delete the branch.

### 11. Everyone else now needs to pull from Development & update their modules
```
git pull origin Development
npm i
```
* Reset database
```
rm server/db/dev.sqlite3
npm run knex migrate:latest
npm run knex seed:run

```

### Update 

run this in the terminal for auth:

```
 cp .env.example .env
```
once your database has first been populated, you can now use this shortcut
to delete the sql file, run migrations and run seed sequentially
```
npm run db-reset
```
## magical git witch shortcut to push your branch --> your branch

```
make pushbranch m='commitMessage'
```
